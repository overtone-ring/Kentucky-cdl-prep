        "The shorter trailer",
        "It doesn't matter"

      "choices": [
        "The first trailer",

        "The rearmost trailer",
        "They all have equal risk"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The rearmost trailer is most likely to turn over due to the 'crack-the-whip' effect during sudden steering movements."

    {
      "id": "dt7",
      "question": "What is the 'crack-the-whip' effect?",

        "When air pressure drops in the system",
        "When the converter dolly disconnects"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The crack-the-whip effect occurs when a sudden steering movement causes the rearmost trailer to swing out much more than the tractor, potentially causing rollover."

        "Further ahead than with singles",
        "Closer than with singles",
        "Only as far as the next light"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Look further ahead when driving doubles or triples because it takes longer to stop and you need more time to react."

        "Release the parking brakes and pull forward"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Lower the landing gear before disconnecting any lines to support the trailer. This prevents the trailer from dropping."

      "id": "dt15",
      "question": "To prevent rollover when driving doubles/triples, you should:",
      "choices": [
        "Speed up through curves for stability",
        "Make quick lane changes when needed",
        "Keep cargo low and take curves slowly",
        "Brake hard entering curves to slow down"
      ],

        "Only increased in bad weather"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Following distance should be greater for doubles/triples because they take longer to stop and require more room for maneuvering."
    },
    {
      "id": "dt20",
      "question": "When you make a sharp turn with doubles/triples, what happens to the rear trailer?",
      "choices": [
        "It follows the same path as the tractor",
        "It cuts the corner more than the tractor",
        "It swings wider than the tractor does",
        "It straightens out and goes straight"
