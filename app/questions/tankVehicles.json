        "Paint condition",
        "Mirror alignment"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Leaks are the most important thing to check for in tank vehicles. Check around the entire tank, fittings, and valves."

      "question": "Baffled tanks help control:",
      "choices": [
        "Side-to-side surge",
        "Forward and backward surge",
        "Both side-to-side and forward/backward surge",
        "Temperature of the liquid"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Baffles help control forward and backward liquid surge. They do NOT prevent side-to-side surge."
    },
    {
      "id": "tv4",
      "question": "Why are smooth bore (unbaffled) tanks often used for food products?",
      "choices": [
        "They are lighter in weight",
        "They cost less to manufacture",
        "They are easier to clean inside",
        "They hold a larger volume"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Smooth bore tanks are easier to clean and sanitize inside, which is essential for hauling food products like milk."
    },
    {
      "id": "tv5",
      "question": "What is 'outage' in relation to tank vehicles?",
      "choices": [
        "A loss of engine power on grades",
        "A failure of the air brake system",
        "Empty space left for liquid expansion",
        "A slow leak from a tank fitting"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Outage is the empty space left in a tank to allow for liquid expansion as temperature increases. Liquids expand when heated."

    {
      "id": "tv6",
      "question": "Compared to solid loads, tank vehicles have a:",
      "choices": [
        "Lower center of gravity",
        "Higher center of gravity",
        "Same center of gravity",
        "Variable center of gravity"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Tank vehicles have a high center of gravity because the liquid cargo is above the wheels, making them more prone to rollover."
    },
    {
      "id": "tv7",
      "question": "What is liquid surge?",
      "choices": [
        "Liquid freezing inside the tank",
        "Liquid moving inside the tank",
        "Pressure building up in the tank",
        "Liquid overflowing from the tank"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Liquid surge is the movement of liquid inside a partially filled tank. This surge can push the vehicle in the direction the liquid moves."
    },
    {
      "id": "tv8",
      "question": "How does liquid surge affect braking?",
      "choices": [
        "It helps the vehicle stop more quickly",
        "It has no noticeable effect on braking",
        "It can push the truck forward after stopping",
        "It causes the brakes to lock up suddenly"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "When you slow down, the liquid surges forward and can push the truck forward. You may have to stop again to fully control the vehicle."
    },
    {
      "id": "tv9",
      "question": "Which takes longer to stop - an empty tanker or a loaded one?",
      "choices": [
        "Loaded tanker",
        "Empty tanker",
        "They stop in the same distance",
        "It depends on the weather"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Empty tank vehicles may take longer to stop than full ones. Keep this in mind when driving an empty or lightly loaded tank vehicle."

        "Brake hard when entering curves"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Drive slowly and carefully, especially on curves and turns. The high center of gravity and liquid surge make tank vehicles prone to rollover."
    },
    {
      "id": "tv11",
      "question": "A tank vehicle is most likely to roll over when:",
      "choices": [

        "Taking a curve too fast",
        "Driving straight on a flat highway",
        "Backing into a loading dock"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Tank vehicles are most likely to roll over when taking curves too fast. The high center of gravity and liquid surge combine to cause rollovers."
    },
    {
      "id": "tv12",
      "question": "Special purpose equipment on a tank vehicle includes:",
      "choices": [

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Tank vehicles may have special equipment like vapor recovery kits, grounding and bonding cables, emergency shut-off systems, and built-in fire extinguishers."
    },
    {
      "id": "tv13",
      "question": "Why is it important to check the intake, discharge, and cut-off valves?",
      "choices": [
        "For appearance",
        "To prevent leaks",
        "To check paint condition",
        "They're not important"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Checking valves is critical to prevent leaks. Make sure they are in the correct positions and aren't damaged or leaking."
    },
    {
      "id": "tv14",
      "question": "When hauling liquids, you should avoid:",
      "choices": [
        "Using lower gears on hills",
        "Sudden braking and acceleration",
        "Checking mirrors frequently",
        "Using turn signals"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Avoid sudden braking and acceleration when hauling liquids. Smooth driving reduces liquid surge and helps maintain control."
    },
    {
      "id": "tv15",
      "question": "A partially filled liquid tank is more dangerous because:",
      "choices": [
        "It is harder to see out the mirrors",
        "The liquid has room to surge and slosh",
        "It is more likely to develop leaks",
        "The brakes wear out more quickly"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Partially filled tanks are more dangerous because the liquid has room to surge and slosh, affecting vehicle stability and handling."
    },
    {
      "id": "tv16",
      "question": "How do bulkheads differ from baffles in a tank?",
      "choices": [
        "Bulkheads have holes to let liquid flow through",
        "Bulkheads completely divide the tank into sections",
        "Bulkheads only reduce side-to-side surge",
        "Bulkheads are used only in food-grade tanks"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Bulkheads completely divide a tank into separate smaller tanks. Unlike baffles (which have holes for liquid flow), bulkheads are solid walls. Drivers must pay attention to weight distribution when loading individual compartments."
    },
    {
      "id": "tv17",
      "question": "A tank may not be fully loaded with a dense liquid like acid because:",
      "choices": [
        "The liquid would expand too much",
        "It could exceed legal weight limits",
        "Dense liquids damage tank linings",
        "Baffles cannot handle heavy liquids"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A full tank of dense liquid (such as some acids) may exceed legal weight limits. Tanks carrying heavy liquids are often only partially filled for this reason."
    },
    {
      "id": "tv18",
      "question": "The amount of liquid to load into a tank depends on:",
      "choices": [
        "Tank color, age, and manufacturer rating",
        "Liquid expansion, weight, and legal limits",
        "Distance to destination and road conditions",
        "Time of year, altitude, and humidity levels"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "How much liquid to load depends on three factors: the amount the liquid will expand in transit, the weight of the liquid, and legal weight limits."
    },
    {
      "id": "tv19",
      "question": "If your drive wheels or trailer wheels begin to skid on a tank vehicle, what can happen?",
      "choices": [
        "The surge effect stops immediately",
        "The vehicle may jackknife",
        "The baffles lock the liquid in place",
        "The tank pressure increases sharply"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "If drive wheels or trailer wheels begin to skid on a tank vehicle, the vehicle may jackknife. Avoid over-steering, over-accelerating, or over-braking to prevent skids."
    },
    {
      "id": "tv20",
      "question": "If you steer quickly while braking in a tank vehicle, you risk:",
      "choices": [
        "Locking the steering column",
        "A vehicle rollover",
        "Draining the air tanks completely",
        "Breaking the baffle connections"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Steering quickly while braking in a tank vehicle can cause a rollover. The high center of gravity and liquid surge combine to make this extremely dangerous."
